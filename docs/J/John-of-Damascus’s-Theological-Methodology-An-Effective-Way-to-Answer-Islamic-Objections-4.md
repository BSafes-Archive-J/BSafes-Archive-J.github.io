## John’s Methodology: An Evaluation
This section shall evaluate John’s Methodology in light of Carl F. H. Henry’s test of truth. Henry offers the current standard in this area. He writes,

> Divine revelation is the source of all truth, the truth of Christianity included; reason is the instrument for recognizing it; Scripture is its verifying principle; logical consistency is a negative test for truth and coherence a subordinate test. The task of Christian theology is to exhibit the content of biblical revelation as an orderly whole.<sup>63</sup>

Henry’s standard includes two premises as axiomatic presuppositions: 1) the God of Christianity is the source of all knowledge and truth, and He has communicated to mankind through divine revelation. Therefore, Scripture is the source of learning about the divine. 2) Theological statements (propositional truth) are assessed according to the laws of human reason and logic.<sup>64</sup> Theological statements are to be dismissed if they violate the law of noncontradiction. Furthermore, theological propositions are required to be consistent with one another. They should not contradict other statements within the same system of thought, or the whole system would be considered internally incoherent. Also, theological statements should help refute the opposing argument. These tests of truth serve as needed tools to invalidate fallacious arguments and guard against veracious ones. In summary, the evangelical test for truth utilizes Scripture as a source for the knowledge of God. It also uses human reasoning as a positive verification principle (when propositions cohere with each other and with the entire system of truth), and as a negative verification principle (when propositions refute the opposing arguments and show the inadequacy of the other systems).

By stating this, one can notice that the similarities between John and Henry are great and the differences are minor. Both Henry and John, for instance, concentrate on consistency and coherency of their arguments; however, their starting points might differ. They both focus on the knowledge of God; however, one thinks it should be based on Scripture only, and the other thinks tradition should be included. The next section shall evaluate John’s methodology in the light of Henry’s criteria—focusing on their starting point, presuppositions, and

<sup>64</sup> Laws of logic are: 1) the law of contradiction (for all propositions p, it is impossible for both p and not p to be true), (2) the law of excluded middle (either p or not p must be true, there being no third or middle true proposition between them), and (3) the principle of identity (if a propositional function F is true of an individual variable x, then F is true of x. Another formulation of the principle of identity asserts that a thing is identical with itself, (x = x)).

their use of reason— for the purpose of identifying where the limitations of John’s argument lie.

### The Starting Point of John’s Methodology

As stated earlier, the starting point of Henry’s theological methodology is the Scripture. He believes that “the positive, good, and creative Word of God stands behind us and above us and ahead of us.”<sup>65</sup> He acknowledges that knowing God is important because God is the source of all truth and knowledge. He also believes that man needs God more than ever because of the noetic effect of sin and the corruption that it left to the human thinking and volition. John, on the other hand, does not talk about the noetic effect of sin. Instead, he affirms the limitation of the human understanding. His starting point is the divine knowledge God declared through nature, the Bible, and tradition.

Henry is more explicit about his starting point. While he recognizes the validity of both general and special revelation, he gives particular attention to the special revelation because it is the one, in his opinion, that takes epistemological priority over general revelation. He believes this “not because general revelation is obscure or because man as sinner cannot know it, but because Scripture as an inspired literary document republishes the content of general revelation objectively, over against sinful man’s reductive dilutions and misconstructions of it.” <sup>66</sup> John, nevertheless, does not distinguish this priority. While he acknowledges the importance of the general revelation to the knowledge of God, he also affirms the significance of the special revelation.

Unlike Augustine who believed in the concept of “I understand in order to believe,” John focuses on knowledge. Therefore, it is safe to say that John understands the relationship between faith and reason in terms of “I should know in order to believe.” John does not say this explicitly, but it is embedded in his writings and his concentration on knowing the divine. He states, “Nothing is more honourable than knowledge, for if knowledge is the light of the rational soul, then contrariwise ignorance is darkness.” <sup>67</sup> John’s focus on gaining knowledge of the divine makes knowledge “the proper state of rational beings, so for rational beings, lack of knowledge renders them worse than irrational beings.” <sup>68</sup>

### John’s Presuppositions

John’s method in approaching his readers includes his presuppositions about truth. One of his presuppositions is embedded in his starting point. John presupposes that truth is obvious, and everyone should know what truth is. This is clear in the Greeks’ teachings, as he says, “first, I shall set forth what is most excellent among the wise men of the Greeks, knowing that anything that is true has been given to human beings from God, since ‘every good endowment and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights.’” <sup>69</sup> John’s assertion about the wise Greek men presupposes that most people agree that truth comes from God and that whoever opposes the truth opposes God. While this line of thought does not contradict Henry’s belief, John does not discuss which God he and the Greeks are talking about, nor whether people have natural ability to recognize the truth and its source. He just assumes that it is obvious to them.

In his writings, John adds another presupposition related to the subject of the knowledge of God. His purpose is to help Christians gain knowledge of God, successfully experience him in their lives, and convincingly defend their faith against heresies. As Daniel Sahas notes, “the issue at stake [for John] is not whether God is one or many … the issue at stake is how God can be known.”<sup>70</sup> In John’s opinion, the knowledge of God is the basis of truth. One might say that the difference between Henry and John’s emphases is minor and only rhetorical because they both insist on learning about God from the revelation of God. However, John does not discuss the issue nor anticipate the danger of adding tradition as a source of learning alongside the Bible. Henry, on the other hand, deals with the danger of giving tradition the same authority as the Bible as a divine source to teach about God. This teaching makes tradition infallible and inerrant; and if this is true, then there should be no collision between both of them.

In relation to the topic of truth, both Henry and John presuppose the importance of vocabulary and definitions. Human beings cannot live and communicate deeply without language, and language consist of words, which in turn consist of meaning. Henry states, “The claim of Jesus of Nazareth to know and proclaim the Word and teaching of God is nonsense if words are inherently distortive and deceptive.”<sup>71</sup> Henry’s claim is true because if words are emptied of their meaning, then there is no point to all what is being written or said. Deceit

easily becomes the new trend. John, on the other hand, warns against using highly sophisticated language for the same purpose: to prevent deceiving other people. During his days, the majority of people were uneducated in the official languages (Greek or Arabic) because people spoke Aramaic (Syriac). Social elites were the ones who had the privilege of learning official languages. In the monastery, monks learned and used Greek, a dynamic which concerned John. He states, “Let us not belittle that which is good [art of rhetoric]. Nor let us use the art of rhetoric for the deception of simpler folk.”<sup>72</sup> John asks his readers and fellow teachers to use adaptable and understandable semantics, lest they deceive the less-educated people with their sophisticated language. This advice indicates how important language was to him, and how important its use is. It could easily become a deceptive instrument. As Henry states, “When truth is lost, falsehood no longer exists, and everything becomes relative to its own situation.”<sup>73</sup>
