## The Efficacy of John’s Methodology in Answering the Saracen
The Efficacy of John’s Methodology in Answering the Saracen John writes against 103 heresies spreading during his time. His apology against Islamic belief is what made him famous in the western word. The means, manners, and modes of his methodology show a great knowledge of Islam. Moreover, his methodology’s internal coherency and causal adequacy are what make it very effective against Islamic objections.

### The Means of John’s Theological Method in Answering the Saracen

John calls the Muslims the Ishmaelites, Hagarenes, and Saracens. His etymology for all these names comes respectively from Ishmael (Abraham’s elder son by his wife’s slave), Hagar (Abraham’s slave wife), and Sarah and her descendants (Abraham’s wife). <sup>74</sup> According to Louth, “The Damascene’s derivation of ‘Saracen,’ etymologically perhaps a term meaning ‘Eastern’ applied to Arabs, is more fanciful.” <sup>75</sup> These names are not used in today’s scholarship because everyone refers to the Saracen’s heresy as the religion of Islam.

Some of John’s historical means cannot be verified today by scholars. For instance, John asserts that Muslims believe in a stone that is the head of Aphrodite

and that they call it Khabar.<sup>76</sup> He also mentions that this stone was built by Abraham. If John is referring to al-Ka’ba, however, then there is no Islamic document known today that calls al-Ka’ba Aphrodite or Khabar. Barbra Roggema states that “a number of late antique sources describe the Arabs as worshippers of Aphrodite, and it has been often been suggested, but never clearly proven, that this refers to the cult of al ‘Uzzà, who was worshipped by many Arabian tribes, and whose name features in the Qur’an alongside Allàt and Manàt.”<sup>77</sup> The Qur’an mentions that Arabian tribes worshipped female gods; however, they give them different names. So, it is unclear where John got the names Aphrodite or Khabar.

John conveys critical information about the sources of Mohammad’s prophecy when he suggests that Mohammad obtained information about Jesus from an “Arian monk.” Arianism was a fourth-century heresy, which taught that Jesus is less than God because there was a time before Christ, a time when Jesus did not exist. With reference to the “Arian monk,” John might be pointing to a *hadith* about Bahira monk,<sup>78</sup> who had predicted the future prophetic status of Mohammad.<sup>79</sup> According to Sahas, “This tradition was, later, utilized by the Muslims as an answer to the challenge of the Christians that Muhammad was an ‘un-announced’ and, thus a false prophet.”<sup>80</sup> John does not seem to know about this tradition and *hadith*, especially when one considers that many scholars date *hadiths* to 200 years after the death of Mohammad. Sahas speculates that John’s preference for the identity of the monk as an Arian “reflects the initial impression that Islam made upon him, and it explains the content and the character of his refutation.”<sup>81</sup> The idea that “the one did not influence the other,” according to Peter Schadler, “was common to engage in the practice of identifying new heresies with older ones to discredit them in order to educate one’s audience theologically, it is argued that John was similarly engaged in this rhetorical practice.”<sup>82</sup> If this is true, then it seems that John, while associating new heresies

with old theological ideas, is attempting to explain the thoughts of a new heretic while simultaneously condemning the new heresy by association. In doing so, John is unwittingly presupposing that the new heresy is an Arian heresy from an Arian monk rather than an Islamic theology from an authentic Islamic source like *hadith*

### The Manners of John’s Theological Method in Answering the Saracen.

John structures his argument based on previous works. Some scholars think that while writing the *Orthodox Faith*, he might have relied on other resources for the structure as a whole. Joseph Langen contends that the book follows the structure of the *Book of Heresies* by Theodoret of Cyrus.<sup>83</sup> Nevertheless, Louth revisits Langen’s claim and concludes that John’s language and structure are too distinct from the *Book of Heresies* of Theodoret. He views any similarities between the two texts’ structures as either coincidental or a hint that John and Theodoret both relied on a previous conventional system, one based on the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed. <sup>84</sup>

The manner that John uses to start his presentation includes an offensive style. For instance, John presupposes that the Ishmaelites’ religion is superstitious because it is a forerunner of the antichrist.<sup>85</sup> He indicates that Mohammad is a false prophet, who concocted his heresy from the Old and New Testaments and from a conversation with an Arian monk (only later did Mohammad claim to have a revelation from heaven). John does not use an evidential method to examine the authentication and the historicity of the Qur’an, nor does he give reasons behind these claims. He even uses sarcasm and includes fling elements in his defense. For instance, after giving a historical background about Islam and Mohammad, he states, “and from these ‘laughable revelations’ he [Mohammad] taught his followers to worship God.” <sup>86</sup> This style is not being used recently in the west, especially among conservative evangelical scholars, because it cuts the relationship and stops the interreligious dialogue. In comparison to contemporary research standard, John’s method seems polemic.

### The Modes of John’s Theological Method in Answering the Saracen

John uses a traditional technique against the Ishmaelites, one consistent with the teaching of the Bible. Instead of categorizing the Islamic belief as a religion, he condemns Islamic theology as a heresy. He does this because any false doctrine of those who believe in what is contrary to the orthodox belief of the church was traditionally considered as heresy. Within the same context, John includes twenty heresies that he calls the “mother of heresies.” This term signifies his view of Christian truth: he considers Christianity the standard by which all other heresies/religions should be judged. Whenever a religion proclaims something contrary to the Bible or a distortion of its truth, it is then deemed heretical.<sup>87</sup>

The mode that John follows in answering the Saracen includes the practice of exposing their double standards in defending their prophets. In an attempt to verify the Islamic claims about Mohammad’s prophecy, for example, John asks them about the evidences that they have to prove the authenticity of Mohammad’s prophecy. And when he hears their answer (which seems to have been approximate to “because the Qur’an says so”), John, rather than considering their answer to be circular, attempts to show its weakness in a different way. He states, “Although you may not marry a wife without witnesses, or buy, or acquire property; although you neither receive an ass nor possess a beast of burden unwitnessed … yet it is only your faith and your scriptures that you hold unsubstantiated by witnesses.”<sup>88</sup> John points out the hypocrisy and the double standards of Muslims following and accepting the prophecy and office of Mohammad without any evidence or witness, while demanding witnesses within their ordinary acts of life. In short, John’s technique tries to show that the claim of Saracen about Mohammad’s prophecy is unverifiable.

### The Coherency of John’s Argument in Answering the Saracen

John’s argument is internally coherent with the teachings of the Old and New Testaments. In relation to his answer to the prophecy of Mohammad, it is evident that John had the Old Testament criteria of authenticating a prophet in mind. God warns the Israelites about false prophets and their inevitable presence. “If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD does not take place or come true,” says God, “that is a message the LORD has not spoken” (Deut 19: 22). He additionally warns them against those who persuade people to believe in

another God after performing wonders and miracles (Deut 13:1-3). Based upon what the Old Testament teaches, John states that Mohammad’s prophecies, if he were a true prophet, should have agreed with the earlier prophets like Moses and David who foretold the coming of Christ (Num 24:17; Psalms 110:1-4). John reminds his readers that “they not only foretold his coming, but they would have agreed with the view that ‘Christ is God, and the Son of God,’ and that he would be ‘Crucified, and die, and rise again, that he will be the judge of the living and the dead.’” <sup>89</sup> In other words, John states that Mohammad should follow the belief of the Old and New Testaments if he is in fact a prophet from God. John’s logic shows consistency and internal coherency with biblical teachings.

### The Causal Adequacy of John’s Argument in Answering the Saracen

A theory is causally adequate if it specifies causal factors that plausibly produce the effects in need of explanation.<sup>90</sup> John’s argument for the nature of God satisfies this principle, even going beyond it to refute the Islamic claim about the oneness of God. After introducing some essential theological terminologies in the *Fount of Knowledge*, John further explains the theological doctrines related to the terms. In his *Summa*, for example, John clarifies that Jesus, the Logos, is God, who is distinct from the One in whom He has His subsistence. Then employing an analogy consistent with biblical teachings, John explains how the words of God and the words of mankind differ in their essence. The words of human beings are generated in the mind and share in the essence of that thought. When the words are spoken, they disperse into air. While they remain as words, their nature changes; they become non-subsistent in themselves. The eternal Word (Jesus Christ), on the other hand, while He is generated from the Father, does not pass out from Him but always remains within Him. The Logos is fully distinct from the Father and yet has His subsistence within the Father. The only way that this can be explained is through the unity of the one God, who must exist in more than one hypostasis and yet remain perfect in His unity.<sup>91</sup> This explanation, therefore, is causally adequate with the biblical teachings about the nature of God and stands in contrast to the oneness of God that Islam teaches.
