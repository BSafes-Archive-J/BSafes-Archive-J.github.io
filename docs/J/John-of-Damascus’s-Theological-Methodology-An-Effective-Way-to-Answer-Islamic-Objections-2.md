## John of Damascus’s Life, Background, and Context
John’s Family and Civil Life 

John of Damascus—also called John Damascene—came from an influential Christian family in Damascus, Syria. His grandfather, Mansur ibn Sargun, was the one who surrendered the city of Damascus to the Islamic leader Khalid ibn al-Walid because he had been the financial governor of Damascus when the Arabs besieged the city in AD 635. <sup>2</sup> Mansur passed his position down through the family line to his son and later to his grandson, John, who in addition to his financial responsibilities was appointed the first counselor to the caliph.

This position indicates that John received good education in his life, leading him to speak several languages including Greek and Arabic. In AD 716, John entered St. Sabas monastery near Jerusalem to start his monastic life.<sup>3</sup> During his life in the monastery, John wrote several books, including *The Fount of Knowledge* (considered the first *Summa*), *The Orthodox Faith* (not a compilation, but a synthesis of Greek theology), *On Heresies* (a summarized work similar to Irenaeus and Hippolyte’s works against heresies), and many other

books. While all were written in Greek, only the previous three were translated to English. 

John was also a speaker and a preacher. According to Frederic Chase, John “was a preacher of the first order and, although his style is at times more effusive and exalted, he may be said to rank with the great Chrysostom.”<sup>4</sup> His sermons were polemic and somewhat dogmatic. In the title of one of John’s homilies, he is described as a Presbyter (priest) of the Holy resurrection of Christ our God, which may refer to the church of Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem.<sup>5</sup> Furthermore, because John defended the Christian faith during the 8th century against Islamic objections, Daniel Janosik considers John the first apologist to the Muslims. <sup>6</sup>

### John’s Theological Islamic Context

Like followers of any other religion, Muslims wrestled with specific theological topics. Their focus often centered on issues related to faith and works, predestination and free will, and the uncreated nature of the Qur’an. As Christians and Jews developed their theological doctrines by answering and criticizing the heresies that they faced, Muslim theologians developed their own counterarguments. In the same manner, John felt the need to develop and contextualize his teachings about God and the Trinity against several heresies, especially one he calls the “heresy of the Ishmaelites.”<sup>7</sup> The pattern of developing and re-contextualizing religious doctrines was and is still happening today, underscoring its importance.

At that time, the topics that Muslims were wrestling with related to whether the Qur’an is the eternal word of Allah and whether it is created or uncreated. In the Umayyad era, most Muslims thought of the Qur’an as uncreated, and, therefore, as eternal—like Allah’s power, knowledge, and attributes. Janosik explains that “since the Qur’an is his [Allah] revelation to man through the act of

<sup>7</sup> Janosik explains that early Christians called Islam a heresy because this is how they viewed the developing of Islamic religion. There were many similarities and historical connections that made them view Islam as a heresy, not a new religion.

speaking, then the Qur’an itself must be eternal like God himself.”<sup>8</sup> In other words, Allah’s speech is eternal with him, and since the Qur’an is Allah’s speech, then the Qur’an must be eternal.<sup>9</sup> This would also indicate that the Qur’an is uncreated because it is part of Allah’s nature (like his attributes), and it is, therefore, eternal with him. This line of thought suggests that Allah predestined the Arabs and all the events recorded in the Qur’an from eternity. The Muslim caliphs promoted this position because it strengthened their rule over the people and helped them safely do what they pleased.<sup>10</sup> It is worth noting that this view is the dominant view today among Sunnis, especially in the Arabic world.

During John’s time, another group also flourished. The Mu’tazilites gave priority to logic over scripture. They opposed the main view of God’s predestination, claiming that God’s divine justice requires human free will and responsibility, otherwise God would be the only one responsible for evil and unjust acts.<sup>11</sup> Moreover, Mu’tazilites opposed the Sunni belief that the speech act of Allah is anthropomorphism, and the Qur’an is not eternal with or part of the nature of God—otherwise it would ultimately destroy the unity of God. If the Qur’an existed apart from God (which it did on *Al-Lawh Al-Mahfouz*), <sup>12</sup> then there would be two eternal entities rather than one, and the unity of God would be compromised.<sup>13</sup> Therefore, by using reason and giving it a priority over revelation, the Mu’tazilites concluded that the Qur’an had to be created. It seems that John

<sup>9</sup> Not all Muslims believe that the Qur’an is Allah’s speech. A subset called Mu’tazilites believed that the speech of Allah is anthropomorphism, which will negatively affect the unity of the God. The Sunnis, on the other hand, believed that Allah’s revelation is Allah’s speech. It is eternal, such as Allah’s power, knowledge, and attributes, but it was descended from heaven in three stages: the first one is when the Qur’an descended to* Al-Lawh Al-Mahfouz* (the Book of Decrees/the Preserved Tablet) (Surah 57:22; 85:22). *Al-Lawh Al-Mahfouz* is a tablet that Allah had saved in the highest heaven, where all the ecumenical events that have happened and all that will happen are kept in the tablet forever. The second descension was when the Qur’an descended as a whole to *Beit Al-Iza* (the House of Glory), which is another place in heaven, where Jibril (angel Gabriel) has access to the words of the Qur’an. Finally, the third descension took place when the verses of the Qur’an came down to the heart/mind of Mohammad. While the Qur’an was descended as a whole to *Al-Lawh Al-Mahfouz* and to the dwelling place of Jibril in *Beith Al-Iza*, it partially and gradually came down to Mohammad.

was aware of this Islamic dispute and based his argument over the Sunnis’ argument to prove the oneness of God.
