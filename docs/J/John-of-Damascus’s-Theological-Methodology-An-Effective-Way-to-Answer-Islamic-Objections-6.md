## Conclusion
Understanding John’s background, life, and education is essential to recognizing his theological method. Based on the inspired word of God, tradition, and reason, John systematizes explicitly and implicitly the truth-content of Christian theology. In comparison, his theological method shows only minor differences to the Scripture-centered methodology of conservative modern evangelicalism, where the key difference is his equal emphases on Scripture and tradition.

Henry’s test of truth principle shows that John’s argument, which relies on the Old and New Testaments in his answers, is internally coherent. It also shows the causal efficacy of John’s argument because the Logos within his theological method is fully distinct from the Father and yet has His subsistence within the Father. The only way that this can be explained is through the unity of the one God. The illustration of God’s Word and Spirit is another factor that shows John’s logical consistency and wide knowledge about Islamic literature. Despite the fact that he does not mention his sources about Islam, his background (i.e., his life, education, and the experience of living in the shadow of the mosques of the Dome of the Rock and of Al‐Aqs) made his arguments against Islamic objections— especially his apology on the doctrine of the Trinity—very effective.
