## John of Damascus’s Theological Methodology
In his writings against Christian heresies, John of Damascus demonstrates the need to prepare Christians to defend their beliefs against objections and against the new religious doctrines that were assailing the church throughout the Middle East.<sup>14</sup> This is not necessarily a bad thing. The existence of heresies throughout history has helped the church formulate, advance, and contextualize their doctrines. John was not an exception. He was fully aware of this danger of heresies, the history of the church, and how the early fathers faced handling them. Therefore, he saw a great need to inform the church about its orthodox belief by formulating his *Summa (The Orthodox Faith)* and writing his book *On Heresies.* These works detailed the heresies, taught Christians why these beliefs are mistaken, and answered the objections they raised against Christianity.

### The Role of Scripture in John’s Methodology

John’s methodology starts with God himself and his revelation to humanity by the prophets, apostles, and evangelists. John admits that God is unknowable; however, certain facts about the divine can be grasped because “the Only-begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him.”<sup>15</sup> Accordingly, since the declarations of the Son about God came to us through the Scriptures, all the writings should be followed.

John uses the Bible frequently in his writings. Sometimes he uses direct quotations without referencing them; and other times he paraphrases, integrates, and blends biblical concepts directly into his teachings. The abundance of scriptural references intermixed with his writings indicates that the Bible plays an important role in John’s thinking and in the presentation of his message. John gives great attention to the Bible because he admits that man is limited in his knowledge, and he cannot reach to God by himself; therefore, God had to declare himself to man. John believes that it is impossible “to understand anything about God beyond what has been divinely proclaimed to us, whether told or revealed, by the sacred declaration of the Old and New Testament.”<sup>16</sup> This statement demonstrates how greatly John revered the Bible and why he used it in his

writings the way he did.

John does not believe that the Bible should be read only by monks and religious men. On the contrary, he advises that all Christians should read the Bible.<sup>17</sup> Moreover, he considers the Scripture a good source for knowledge—not just religious knowledge, but knowledge in general. He states, “Let us knock at the very beautiful paradise of the Scriptures, the fragrant, most sweet and lovely paradise…let us not knock casually, but with eagerness and persistence… should we read once and then a second time and still not understand what we are reading, let us not be discouraged.” <sup>18</sup> John encourages people to be persistent and eager while they read the Scriptures and study Christian tradition, even if they do not understand everything completely. He then encourages them to rely on God the Father for further understanding. <sup>19</sup>

While John affirms the role of the Scripture in his writings, he does not emphasize it as much as evangelical theologians have historically done. Evangelical theology, which is rooted in the reformation, holds to the doctrine of *Sola Scriptura* and believes that Scripture alone is the final authority in religious knowledge, including theological doctrine, dogma, and morality. According to Matthew Barrett, Scripture is the only “self-authenticating” source of knowledge because God is its author.<sup>20</sup> Carl F. H. Henry stresses the fact that “divine revelation is the evoking cause of Christian theology and faith, and the ultimate criterion of all evangelical doctrine.”<sup>21</sup> While John might not disagree with this claim, he does not emphasize it in his writings.

Since John is one of the main theologians of the Eastern Orthodox church, some scholars see his methodology as mainly Christocentric. Andrew Louth explains that there is no real consensus over how the Scriptures are to be interpreted in the Eastern Orthodox theology.<sup>22</sup> The New Testament is read in its entirety every year in church services in conjunction with the divine liturgy, and the Old Testament is read selectively. However, Louth concludes that the way the

Orthodox Church treats the Scriptures suggests that it does not see the Scripture as a collection of infallible texts, but rather it sees it as a body of witness of varying significance to Jesus Christ.<sup>23</sup>

To be fair to John’s theology, it is important to note that his methodology seems to be both Bible-centered and Christ-centered. John uses biblical verses extensively in his writings. He does not consider the Bible errant; rather, it often functions as the vehicle for explaining something else, such as another passage of Scripture, or another subject/concept. Moreover, John uses the Scripture as a sort of authoritative dictionary. He defines important terms in theological discussion by referencing the way Scripture uses them. In the book *The Orthodox Faith*, John writes about the Godhead and that no one knows the Father but the Son. In order to covey this idea, he connects 1 John 1:18, Matthew 11:27, and 1 Corinthians 2:11 together, stating that since no one can know God but the Son, Jesus declared the Father to us.<sup>24</sup> In this way, he uses biblical data to convey what the Son has declared.

At the same time, John’s theological methodology is Christocentric. The nature of the heresies that he refuted required him to focus on the two natures of Christ and the Trinity. John provides a thorough defense for the Trinity “against what he saw as a heresy of Christianity, [and] there was a need to prepare Christians to defend their beliefs against the new religious doctrine that was assailing the Christian church throughout the Middle East.”<sup>25</sup> Many heresies were spreading in his days, such as Monophysitism, Nestorianism, Arianism, Jacobitism, and what he called “the Ishmaelites” (Islam). All these heresies targeted the divine nature of Jesus, which compelled John to recognize the great need for a definition/framework for the Christian orthodox faith, especially the deity of Christ and the Trinity. John acknowledges that God “has given us knowledge of Himself in accordance with our capacity, at first through the Law and the Prophets and then afterwards through His only-begotten Son, our Lord and God and Saviour, Jesus Christ.”<sup>26</sup> To John, God declared himself both through his word and through his son, Jesus Christ.

### The Role of Tradition in John’s Methodology

The English word *tradition* comes from the Latin term *traditio*, which means “handing over,” “handing down,” or “hanging on.”<sup>27</sup> According to Alister McGrath, this term has two levels of meaning: at one level, it is a biblical idea that Paul references in 1 Corinthians 15:1-4.<sup>28</sup> Paul “reminded his readers that he was handing on to them core teachings of the Christian faith, which he had received from other.” <sup>29</sup>The second level of meaning includes the body of teachings that passed on throughout the church’s history. The term also refers to teaching the Bible within the church and passing on the teachings to others from previous generations. In these ways, tradition is a process as well as a body of teaching. Moreover, McGrath points out that the New Testament uses the notion of tradition in a negative sense, referring to human ideas and practices that are not grounded in Scripture.<sup>30</sup> Thus, theologians today should follow the steps of Jesus, who, during his life on earth, upheld some traditions as good and right while criticizing others as man-made. He certainly believed in the passing on of tradition (he quotes the law and the prophets extensively) but also believed that tradition should be critiqued (Matt 15:1-16; Mark 7:13).

Both levels of tradition are referenced in John’s Summa explaining the nature of God. Regarding the first level of meaning (the teaching of the church), John asserts that the belief and the declaration about the nature of God should not go beyond what God has revealed “by the sacred declarations of the Old and New Testaments.”<sup>31</sup> Regarding the second meaning (the process of handing down the tradition), John seems to hold a unique position. Although he gives the Bible a high stance in his methodology, he seems to equate the Bible with tradition as equally authoritative bases for what Christians know about God. After summarizing the Christian doctrines of prior theologians that he learned in the monastery, he explains that “all those things that have been handed down by the Law and the Prophets and the Apostles and the Evangelists, and we know and

revere them, and over and above these things we seek nothing else.”<sup>32</sup> Being born and raised in Damascus, Syria myself, I do not believe that John means by saying “we seek nothing else” that reason and experience do not factor into his biblical explanation, for these tools are used greatly in his writings. Instead, I believe he means that the Bible and tradition are the major sources of knowledge that he seeks to know God. Therefore, John seems to lend equal credence give equal importance to both the Bible and tradition, by considering them equally valid. <sup>33</sup> In other words, John equates what the Holy Spirit has written through the prophets and the apostles to what the church’s fathers have written in the early centuries of Christianity.

To further support his position, John explains that some leaders in the church were given special gifts that others were not; therefore, the special leaders can authoritatively teach about God. John states,

> The shepherds and teachers who succeeded to their grace of the Spirit and by the power of their miracles and the word of their grace enlightened those who were in darkness and converted those who were in error. Now, let us who have not received the gifts of miracles and teaching, … invoke the aid of the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost, and discuss some few of the things which the expounders of grace have handed down to us.<sup>34</sup>

John adopts a humble tone and includes himself with the group of people who do not have the special grace; however, he still teaches and declares the truth of orthodox Christian faith.

The line of thought in the Eastern Orthodox church is compatible with John’s writing because both of them tend to attribute a certain authority to the saints, spiritual leaders, and *startsy* (as the Russians and Romanians call them) in preserving the truth, setting limits, and guiding the Christian community. John Meyendorff, who represents the Eastern Orthodox view, believes that the written words of God are very essential to practicing theology; however, he does not consider theology simply a science. Theologians are not becoming theologians by simply using Scripture as initial data because theology presupposes living in a community of the church. Just as God spoke with Israel as the chosen people, He

will speak to us today.<sup>35</sup> As Israel’s literature and history combined as vehicles of divine revelation, <sup>36</sup> in the same manner, the Bible is meant to be read among the Christian community. God, therefore, speaking through the community of the church, is what makes divine revelation. Moreover, Meyendorff advocates for the evolving revelation theory, which consists of the idea that “new writings continued to be added to the Old Testament collection until the time of Christ, but the New Testament was closed ... There was a continuous revelation to the Old Israel, but nothing of the sort is possible in the new dispensation, because salvation has been accomplished once and for all in Christ” <sup>37</sup> That is to say, Meyendorff believes the new revelation extended until the last witness to the resurrection of Christ was dead. The church’s role is to define the limits of the authentic witness. But it cannot add any new revelation to the cannon.

Conservative evangelicals, on the other hand, acknowledge the importance of historical theology; however, they argue that “tradition and church officials play a ministerial role… [whereas] Scripture alone plays a *magisterial* role.”<sup>38</sup> Considering Scripture *magisterial* means that when tradition and Scripture collide, Scripture should be given more priority. Considering tradition ministerial means that tradition might contain some misunderstandings, and, therefore, should be continually revised and reformed by scriptural analysis and application.

McGrath highlights a very important point that is seen clearly in the Eastern Orthodox churches. He states, “tradition carries with it the sense of ‘traditionalism’—the dead hand of previous generations that demands we continue to think and act in precisely the same manner as earlier generations, thus locking evangelicalism into a sixteenth-, eighteenth-, or nineteenth-century worldview.”<sup>39</sup> This danger, according to McGrath, puts tradition in direct opposition to modernity. While tradition should not be overlooked for the sake of establishing the authority of the church over its congregation, allocating a supreme authority to the Scripture does not necessitate rejecting the role of tradition wholesale. <sup>40</sup> Therefore, it is important to recognize the work of the historical community of faith and incorporate it in today’s theological studies.

### The Role of Experience in John’s Theology

John does not write about the role of experiencing the divine in his life. This could be because he was born into a Christian family and did not start writing until later on in his life. Or perhaps he was humble enough to include himself with the saints. <sup>41</sup> However, there is a story which, though hard authenticate, may be considered the reason behind John leaving his prestigious job at the government and starting his monastic life. An Arabic source, written by Kamal Yazaji and forwarded by Archbishop George Khider, states that emperor Leo III banned the use of icons, but John wrote three treatises against his mandate. As a retaliation, emperor Leo sent several forged letters to the caliph, embroiling John in a treasonous plot against him. As punishment for disloyalty, the caliph orders John’s right hand amputated. <sup>42</sup> Yazaji states that John prayed to the *Theotokos* (The mother of God—Mary) and put his amputated hand on his arm. When he woke up the next morning, his hand was healed. When the caliph saw the healed hand, he declared John innocent and offered him a promotion. John chose the monastic life instead.<sup>43</sup> This fundamental story is widely circulated in the Arabic Eastern Orthodox tradition.

Though it’s unknown whether this story is wholly accurate, especially since it is omitted from John’s own writings, an event such as this could have played a major role in John’s decision in choosing the monastic life.

Eastern Orthodox theology, in general, focuses on experience. Harry Boosalis, professor at St. Tikhon states, “The study of theology is primarily a spiritual process. The believer must first be exposed to, edified by and ultimately identified [sic] with the time-honored Tradition of the Church Fathers.”<sup>44</sup> This statement might seem more cognitive than experiential; however, Boosalis continues to explain what he means by tradition. He states, “Ultimately, Holy Tradition is spiritual *experience*; it is personal participation in the life of divine grace. It is this two-thousand-year spiritual tradition that the believer participates in, and comes to call his own.”<sup>45</sup> In summation, personal experience is the most important aspect of the Eastern Orthodox theology.

While it may hold a primary position, personal experience is not the sole way in which Eastern Orthodox theology is informed. Prayer and liturgy also play a major role. According to Boosalis, “For the Fathers of the Church, theology is an existential experience of the life in Christ. Theology is the process of the transfiguration of the human person. Theology is a life of prayer and asceticism centered within the liturgical life of the Church and immersed in Holy Scripture.”<sup>46</sup> This concept fits within John’s teaching, for all what he has taught is for the purpose of making a person a better Christian. John states that when we read the Scripture, it “fills our ears with the varied songs of inspired spiritual birds, which touches our heart, comforting it when grieving, calming it when angry, and filling it with everlasting joy …”<sup>47</sup> This picture focuses on the reader’s feelings and experience while reading the Scripture instead of his cognitive state. This picture indicates that John’s theological and philosophical methodology aims at allowing the best experience of Christ in the lives of Christians through learning philosophy and practicing prayer and liturgy.

On the contrary, experience plays a subordinate but important role in evangelical theology and life. While many conservative evangelical theologians ignore or minimize the role of experience in theology, perceiving and literally feeling God’s presence is considered by many other evangelical theologians as “a powerful epistemological guarantee for the truth of Christian belief.”<sup>48</sup> While many conservatives argue that unique personal experience—its data, insights, and power—cannot easily be generalized as a common pattern for all people,<sup>49</sup> others place their personal experience of recognizing God as a priority. In the view of conservative evangelicals, a Christian should not confuse experiential confirmation with Christian knowledge or divine causes because experience is derived and sought by direct connection to Scripture.

Millard Erickson, who is considered one of the greatest evangelical theologians in the twentieth century, warns his readers against a position that became popular during his time, which is similar to John/Eastern Orthodox’s position on the Scripture and experience. Erickson calls it the neo-orthodox position on the Scripture. He states, “If revelation is regarded as the communication of propositional truths, then faith will be viewed as a response of assent, of believing those truths. If, on the other hand, revelation is regarded as the

presentation of a person, then faith will correspondingly be viewed as an act of personal trust or commitment.” <sup>50</sup> The later view—similarly to John and Eastern Orthodox position—does not think of theology as a revealed set of doctrines. Instead, it is the church’s attempt to express what has been found in God’s revelation of himself. Liturgy resembles the language of prayer and worship, whereas propositional theology resembles the language of discourse. The danger of the position that Erickson is refuting (John’s position) lies in the person’s perception about his or her experience of the divine. If the experience is elevated over propositions, then how can that person know that he or she is worshipping the God of Christianity, says Erickson. <sup>51</sup>

In an attempt to answer Erickson’s objection, Louth, coming from an Eastern Orthodox background, might say that,

> For John the whole purpose of the Fountain Head of Knowledge is to deepen our understanding of Scripture, or perhaps better, our encounter with Christ in the Scriptures, for, in common with the general patristic view, John does not see the Scriptures as a collection of revealed information, but rather as the place where, through careful reading and pondering, prepared for by ascetic struggle and the acquisition of the virtues, we may encounter Christ himself.<sup>52</sup>

Louth believes that if the Bible is to be read because of the comfort and the joy that it brings, its truth, statements and proposition will automatically be minimized. But, if it is read to learn about who Christ is, then the person supposedly should know Christ through the experience. However, Louth’s answer does not take into consideration the real reason that made John concentrate on the Trinity and Christ’s nature. It also ignores the amount and the nature of the heresies that were circulating during John’s time.

### The Role of Reason in John’s Theology

John wrote a complete book (the *Fount of Knowledge*) on philosophy and reason. He wrote this book at the request of his friend Cosmas of Maiuma. The work was dedicated to him as a bishop of Maiuma in AD 743. In it, John’s

intention is to bring the best of Greek philosophy that has been offered.<sup>53</sup> According to Chase, “The philosophical introduction is new being the first attempt to present a complete manual of philosophy to serve as a basis for the study of Christian theology.”<sup>54</sup> In this work, John presents several topics related to philosophy, logic, and reason. For example, he dedicates a whole chapter to the definition of a statement, its negation, and its affirmation. He states, “so-and-so is not wise, so-and-so does not walk. Since a negation is opposed to every affirmation and an affirmation to every negation, the negation opposed to the affirmation and the affirmation opposed to the negation are called contradictions.”<sup>55</sup> This concept might sound primitive to the contemporary readers; however, it was essential to John’s culture and surrounding. Moreover, John allocates several chapters to define terms, premises, and syllogism. He also assigns another chapter to explain different philosophical concepts, such as interrogation, inquiry, antiparastasis, heresy, thesis, substance, and simple excogitation. John explains these terms, outlines their relation to each other, and provides examples from daily life. For instance, when explaining the hypostatic union, he gives an example of the soul and the body.

John’s use of reason to interpret Scripture falls into two broad categories. First, he uses basic reason to define terms and make distinctions, helping him present his concepts and prepare his readers for biblical arguments. Second, John often uses reason to examine the implications of Scripture. He frequently makes use of precise definitions and distinctions, which were frequently overlooked, misunderstood, or ignored by others. For example, he defines philosophy as the “knowledge of divine and human things … philosophy is the study of death… philosophy is a becoming like God … it is in justice, sanctity, and goodness that we become like God.”56 John brings a new perspective on the definition of philosophy and concludes that “the love of God—this is the true philosophy.”<sup>57</sup>

John’s use of reason is particularly apparent in his apologetical argument against Islam. In his book *On Heresies*, he includes a long list of several types of heresies.58 He starts with Barbarism and ends with Doxarii. These heresies were supposedly in play during his time, and he believes that they needed to be

addressed because of their dangerous effect on the Christian belief. John gives different space and attention to each one of the 103 heresies, allotting few lines for some and dedicating pages to others. The most important heresy relating to the subject of this paper is the *Heresy of the Ishmaelites.*

In this apology against the Ishmaelites heresy (Islamic religion), there is a good example of the use of reason in John’s methodology. Islamic religion accuses Christians of being *Mushrikin* (polytheists, associator, or hetaeriasts); however, John knows that this is a misconception in need of correction. John starts by listing the Islamic Christological belief. For instance, Muslims believe that Jesus was the result of a virgin birth, served as a prophet, and that was called the Spirit of God and his Word (Surah 4:171).<sup>59</sup> John starts his reply with a question, asking: “As long as you say that Christ is the Word of God and his Spirit, why do you accuse us of being Hetaeriasts?” <sup>60</sup> The purpose behind this question is to help his objectors to think through their objections.

After presenting the question, John argues from Islamic literature and brings out the contradictions of the Islamic argument against Jesus. For example, John demonstrates his use of reason by arguing from Qur’an that the Islamic unbelief in the deity of Jesus is irrational:

> “For the word, and the spirit, is inseparable from that in which it naturally has existence. Therefore, if the Word of God is in God, then it is obvious that He is God. If, however, He is outside of God, then according to you, God is without word and without spirit. Consequently, by avoiding the introduction of an associate with God you have mutilated Him.” <sup>61</sup>

In other words, John says that God’s Word and Spirit cannot stand on a separate ground because they are shared within the divine essence. If they are separated, then God will be wordless and spiritless, “as if you were dealing with a stone or a piece of wood or some other inanimate object.”<sup>62</sup> This is impossible because no Christian or Muslim believe in such a god. This advanced use of reason shows how much John valued and used it in his methodology.
