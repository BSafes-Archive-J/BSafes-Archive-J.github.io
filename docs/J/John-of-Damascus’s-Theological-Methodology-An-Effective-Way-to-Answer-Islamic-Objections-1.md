## Introduction
John of Damascus is a Syrian theologian who is not very well known in the West. He is one of the three major theologians of the Eastern Orthodox church, <sup>1</sup> and three of his numerous publications were translated into English. In these works, John emphasizes the role of knowledge in Christian life, encouraging Christians to educate themselves and deepen their understanding of the divine and their Christian beliefs. Throughout, he employs a theological methodology that is very effective against heretical beliefs, emphasizing the roles of Scripture, reason, and tradition in understanding divine revelation. With the help of Carl F. H. Henry’s test of truth principles, this paper shall examine the distinctiveness and the efficacy of John’s theological methodology—especially in comparison to the theological method of conservative modern evangelicalism—noting how it was shaped by his life, education, and experiences.
